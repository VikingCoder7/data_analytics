Question 1:

A portfolio of evidence for a programmer is a collection of work samples and projects that
showcase a programmer's skills, abilities, and achievements. It serves as a tangible
representation of their experience, expertise, and the quality of their work. A well-curated
portfolio can be invaluable when seeking new job opportunities, freelancing gigs, or even
applying for higher education programs.

You are required to create a github account and create a “data analytics repository” for the
following project:

- Folder path on github: data_analytics/natural_language_processing/project
- projects/text mining/un_declearion_hr_insights.py
- projects/text mining/output/word_cloud.png
- projects/text mining/output/most_freq_terms.png
- projects/text_mining/datasets/un_declaration_hr_text_data.txt

Using natural language processing perform text analysis on the UN declaration of Human
rights in order to identify the most pertinent terms in the document.

Make your data_analytics folder public on github and submit your Github web address for
evaluation: e.g. https://github.com/iamkrut

You will be evaluate based on the correctness of your work and the project organisation of your
github page as stipulated..
